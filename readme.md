In this modification of the existing api.js code, a new endpoint (/queryRecords/assets) has been introduced to enable the export of condition ratings from the Firestore database. The code ensures proper authentication, dynamically retrieves the latest approved condition reports for each asset across different organizational units, and formats the data into a flattened structure. The response can be in either JSON or CSV format, catering to the diverse needs of enterprise clients who utilize tools like Excel or PowerBI for further analysis. The implementation is designed with flexibility to adapt to changes in the Firestore schema and organization structure, promoting scalability by efficiently handling large datasets. 
However, due to some of the areas that may need adjustments based on the specific details of your Firestore database and the data stored in reports, testing is recommended to ensure its reliability and correctness. I would be more than happy to assist with this. I'm unsure of the context the app is being used but a schema or a sample csv response could help me be more confident in the datastrucure.

The code assumes the existence of certain fields in the reports, such as assetId, type, and status.status. Ensure that these fields exist in your actual report documents.
Confirm the structure of the attributes field in the report, as this might affect how condition ratings are stored.

Verify that the Firestore structure matches the assumed paths. Confirm that reports are stored under the /orgs/{oid}/units/{uid}/reports path.
Check if there are any additional conditions or filters that should be applied to the Firestore queries. The current code assumes filtering by type, and status.status.
Date Sorting and Filtering:

Confirm that the timestamp (ts) is a valid field in the reports and that it represents the time of the report.
Ensure that the sorting mechanism based on timestamps is appropriate for your use case.

Confirm the structure of the response data (flattenedData). The code assumes certain fields like _id, _unit, and assetId. Adjustments might be necessary based on the actual structure of your report documents.

If exporting to CSV, ensure that the field names and data types match the expectations of the tool (e.g., PowerBI or Excel) that will be used for analysis.# trakk
